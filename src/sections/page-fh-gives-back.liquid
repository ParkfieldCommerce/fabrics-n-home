			<h2 class="title">Fabric for Special Education</h2>
			<p class="lead">
				Every year, under the federal law known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), millions of children with disabilities receive special services designed to meet their individual needs. Fabrics and Home Interiors would like to help support education for children with disabilities by donating .25 per yard for each yard of fabric sold on our website.  IDEA lists 13 different disabilities that effect school-aged children and youth. Fabrics and Home Interiors will choose one of IDEA’s disability categories and make an annual donation. We will vary each donation annually hoping to touch the lives of the many children in our country who need additional support so they can lead happy, productive lives. Many non-profit organizations build their foundations designed to provide students affected by a disability, their families, teachers and support staff with the resources necessary that provide continuous support. Students with disabilities achieve success with appropriate individualized programs designed and implemented by caring kindhearted people.
